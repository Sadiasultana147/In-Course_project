			☆ Books are our good friends and guider.

			☆ Books bring light into darkness and sunshine into shadow.

			☆ Books are like gold mines. They amuse us when we are bored and give us pleasant company when we feel alone.

			☆ Books are free of cost. They demand nothing from us.

			☆ Books encourage us when we are defeated. They inspire us to work hard with hope and courage.

			☆ We should always read good and inspiring books.
			In Pressbooks, the  Book Info page is where you put information about your book. In the book publishing industry, this is called “metadata”— or, data about the data. Metadata allows book stores and libraries categorize a book and make it easier for readers to find. It answers questions such as: What is the title? Who is the author? When was it published? And what is the book about?

			Some pieces of metadata are required and will be filled in by default using the information you entered when you first registered your account and created a book. This information is used for the following purposes:

			To meet the metadata requirements of ebook sellers for your EPUB and MOBI files
			To automatically generate certain pages in your book, including the cover, title page, and copyright notice
			To build a book landing page on the web.This section includes basic information about your book.

			Title: Pressbooks will automatically fill in this section with the title that you first chose when you created the book. However, you can change the title at any time by editing this section. The title will be included in your automatically generated title page, half-title page, and webbook homepage. It may also be in the running content of your PDF files. The title is also required for the metadata that goes into your EPUB file. This section cannot be left blank.

			Short Title: A shorter version of your title can be entered if your full book title is too long for the running content in your PDFs. This field is optional. 

			Subtitle:  Like the title, this information will automatically populate the title page and webbook homepage if entered. The use of a subtitle is optional. 

			Author: The author name is used to populate the automatically generated title page and webbook landing page. It’s also included in the metadata file in your ebook. This field is required, and will default to your Pressbooks username if nothing is entered. For more information on how to add contributors, jump to the Contributors section.
